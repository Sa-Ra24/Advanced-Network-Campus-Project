# Advanced-Network-Campus-Project
Project Overview
This project showcases a comprehensive network infrastructure configuration using Cisco Packet Tracer. The goal was to enhance network performance, security, and reliability through hands-on configuration of various network protocols and services.

Features
The project includes the following configurations:
1.	Basic Device Settings
2.	VLAN Configuration
3.	Spanning Tree Protocol (STP): PortFast, BPDU Guard
4.	EtherChannel
5.	Subnetting & IP Addressing
6.	DHCP Server Configuration
7.	HSRP, Inter-VLAN Routing (SVI), IP Helper Address
8.	OSPF
9.	Firewall Inspection Policies
10.	Server Setup: Web, Email, FTP, DNS
11.	Network Security: Port Security, Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI), DHCP Snooping

## Objectives

### The primary objectives of this project were:
- To design a segmented network using VLANs for enhanced security and traffic management.
- To establish redundancy and improve bandwidth with EtherChannel.
- To implement high-availability features using HSRP.
-	To set up dynamic routing with OSPF.
-	To configure servers and network services for functionality.
-	To secure the network with advanced features like Port Security, DAI, and DHCP Snooping.

## Prerequisites
-	Cisco Packet Tracer: Version 7.3 or higher
-	Basic Knowledge of Networking Concepts: Familiarity with VLANs, STP, EtherChannel, DHCP, routing protocols, and network security.

## Usage
To test and use this configuration:
1.	Open the project file in Cisco Packet Tracer.
2.	Examine and Verify the configurations by running various network tests, such as:
*	Ping Tests: Check connectivity between devices.
*	DHCP Tests: Verify IP address allocation.
*	OSPF Routing: Use show ip route on devices to confirm routes.
*	Security Tests: Attempt various scenarios to test Port Security, DAI, and DHCP Snooping.

## Future Enhancements
In the future, the project could be expanded to include:
-	Advanced routing protocols like BGP.
-	Additional network services like VPN.
-	Improved monitoring and logging through SNMP or Syslog.
